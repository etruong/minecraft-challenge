Instructions:
Altering only the challenge-2.js file (DO NOT ALTER the HTML OR CSS) do the following

1. Using only JavaScript, create the following img DOM elements adding the class .item
    and attach it to the #backpack:
    - 1 Meat (using meat.png and adding the class food)
    - 1 Corn (using corn.jpg and adding the class food)
    - 3 Waterbuckets (using water.png and setting the class to water)
    - 1 Axe (using axe.png and setting the id to axe)
    - 1 pickaxe (using pick.png and setting the id to pick)

2. In the JS, create an on click event listener for the #eat-btn that grabs 
    and removes ONE of the elements in the #backpack with the class .food

3. In the JS, create an on click event listener for the #drink-btn that grabs 
    and removes ONE of the elements in the #backpack with the class .water

4. Challenge: Create an on click event listener for the use item button that 
    takes the value in the input and does the following depending on what is used:
    - If it's the pickaxe it adds a stone (stone.jpeg) into the #backpack with the class .stone
    - If it's the axe it adds wood (wood.gif) into the #backpack with the class .wood
5. Test out if the event listers work, but also make sure to refresh the page before doing
    the next step!
